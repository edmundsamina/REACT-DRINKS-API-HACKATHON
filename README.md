# React-athon

## 18/11/2022 API HACKATHON

This week's hackathon saw my week eight partner and me working on using React to interact with external APIs and develop a front-end webpage. We had just the day to plan, research, design and code our project. 

We decided on using this drinks API 🍸 => https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php. 

The documentation could have been more explicit for beginners. We wasted a few hours fixing an error with our fetch request (we were sending it to www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php instead of https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php 🙃) despite the massive delay in figuring that out; we managed to finish the day with a not pretty, but functional page to show for it. 

I then, over the weekend, went back over the project and added another piece of functionality that we had planned on implementing in our project but did not have the time (search cocktail by ingredients 🫒)

Overall I am happy with what I have created, considering eight weeks ago, I didn't even know what JavaScript was! Let alone React. 

Points to consider next time => 

Plan the project structure clearly before beginning to code; the code can be more efficient and cleaner. 
Plan out the web page's design and where everything will go before starting CSS because, as you can see, the buttons are off-centre. 
Think about the hierarchy of components; this is something I feel that we didn't think about in detail because of the time crunch, but I think it would feed into the other two points and make the code make more sense and wouldn't have made scaling or adding to the project way more effortless.
